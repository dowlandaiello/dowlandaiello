### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Dowland, a full-stack software engineer and high school student living in Greater New York. I specialize in systems programming and
backend / business logic development primarily in Rust and Go.
I have a passion for peer-to-peer networking, and have worked on several bleeding-edge distributed projects over the last few years.
At the moment, I'm working on a decentralized and socially responsible social media network called [Swaply](https://github.com/swap-ly).

If you have any questions regarding my work, please consult any one of the following handles:
